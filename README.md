# Disk Scheduling Algorithms â€“ Java Project

A Java-based implementation of disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. The program simulates and compares FCFS, SSTF, and SCAN algorithms by calculating total seek distances.

## Features
- First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- Head movement simulation and total seek distance calculation
- Performance comparison and best algorithm suggestion

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Command-line Input

## File
- `DiskScheduling.java`: Full implementation of the disk scheduling simulation

## How to Run
1. Open `DiskScheduling.java` in any Java IDE
2. Compile and run the program
3. Follow console prompts to input:
   - Number of cylinders
   - Head position
   - Head direction
   - 15 disk requests
4. Observe head movements and performance analysis
